The program is designed to check customers' baggage at the airport. It will require input for baggage dimensions (length, width, height in cm) and weight (kg) to verify validity.
The system will determine if the baggage is overweight and calculate any surcharge if needed. It also checks if the baggage qualifies as a carry-on. Multiple bags can be processed, allowing users to input dimensions as many times as necessary.
Upon exit, the program will display the total number of bags and the combined weight of all baggage.
